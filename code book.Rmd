This file summarizes all the variables in "wearable2.txt" that is in  run_analysis.r script.First step is to download and unzip datafile from website. Second step is to create two variables reading the data and give new column names. Step 3 is to extract mean and standard deviation of the activity and feature data. Step 4 is to merge training and testing data. Step 5 is to tide the data. Last step is to store the clean data in "wearable2.txt" attached in this repo.

## Identifiers

* Subject: ID of the test participant.
* Activity: one of six activities that have been performed by subjects when the measurements were taken.
